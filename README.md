# 🌸 Enhanced Flower Recognition Using ResNet-50

## 📌 About the Project

This project implements a **flower image classification system using ResNet-50 Transfer Learning**.

A pre-trained **ResNet-50 model with ImageNet weights** is used as the backbone and fine-tuned to classify flower images into **5 different categories**.

The project focuses on improving flower recognition performance through **Transfer Learning, Data Augmentation, and Fine-Tuning**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Classify flower images into five different categories.
* Utilize **ResNet-50 Transfer Learning** for image classification.
* Apply **data augmentation** to improve model generalization.
* Fine-tune the final layers of the pre-trained model.
* Evaluate model performance using multiple classification metrics.
* Visualize training performance and feature maps.

### Transfer Learning Strategy

1. Load the pre-trained ResNet-50 model with ImageNet weights.
2. Remove the original classification head.
3. Add a custom classification layer for 5 flower classes.
4. Initially train the new classification layers.
5. Unfreeze the last 20 layers of ResNet-50.
6. Fine-tune the model using the flower dataset.
